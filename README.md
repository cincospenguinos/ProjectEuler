# Project Euler

My go-to "Hello, World" project to learn a new language

## What is here?

Solutions to [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) problems in a variety of languages. If you intend to solve those problems (and you should! they're really fun!) **I strongly suggest you do not dig into this repo**, unless you have actually solved some of the problems in here.
